## General Info
 This is being made for my senior project and is still a work in progress.
 This project is built with [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and uses C++ 17.

## Build Dependencies
 Most of the libraries (such as SDL2) are linked with the project via NuGet, but some packages need to be installed via [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/).
